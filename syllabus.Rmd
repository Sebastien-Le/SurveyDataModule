title: "How to collect and analyze data with a survey"
---

## Introduction

From a statistical point of view, the objectives of this course are to understand the relationship between variables of different types: when the two variables are quantitative, when a variable is qualitative and the other one is quantitative, when both variables are qualitative. Then, we go for multivariate exploratory analyses such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Correspondence Analysis (CA), and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA).

From an experimental point of view, the objectives of the course are to know how to express properly a problem (an issue), how to *translate* this problem in terms of research question: in other words, what would be the experiment that would give me insights, in order to provide solutions for solving my problem. Within this course, the experiment should lead to a survey, to the construction of a *multivariate* measure that should differentiate the respondents of the survey.

From a practical point of view, I want my students to know how to use a software such as LimeSurvey, to know how to do reproducible research with Rstudio and Rmarkdown, to know how to analyse with R and the FactoMineR package.

In this course, examples are very **perception** oriented.

## Three is the magic number

3 new powers: an introduction to textual analysis, the Q-methodology, the notion of reproducibility.

3 measures of the relationship between variables: correlation coefficient, etha square, chi-square (and you should know how to visualize that).

3 acronyms you should get tattooed on the fist: PCA, CA, MCA (clustering is just the gift wrap).

```{r fistPCA, out.width=350, echo=F,fig.cap="PCA for Principal Component Analysis",fig.align='center'}
